   Our main aim is to provide a one stop location for all your solar information. The brain child behind this project is Mr Viviann Sinclair, a ten years veteran in the solar renewable industry. He has been living completely off the Jamaica Public Service grid, in Jamaica, for over eight years. Note however that the information presented on this website, are formed from our experiences. They are presented to you as guides that may help you through the setting up of your own system.
